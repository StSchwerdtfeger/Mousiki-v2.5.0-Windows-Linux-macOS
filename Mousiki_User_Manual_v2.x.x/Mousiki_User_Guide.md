# Mousiki User Guide v2.5.0 (Windows · Linux · macOS)

This guide walks through **every entry of the in-app cheat sheet** (`?`) in the same order the cheat sheet lists them, and explains what each command does. Some settings that can only be changed in the config.txt are also discussed at the end of this manual. 
The key shown for each command is the **default binding**. Your own bindings may differ if you changed them in `config.txt` or under **Settings → Reference**; the cheat sheet always shows the keys you actually have.

## Before you start

### Rebindable vs. fixed keys

- **Rebindable keys** have an action name like `HKeyPlay` in `config.txt` and appear under **Settings → Reference**. Change them in either place.
- **Fixed keys** are written as literal key names in the cheat sheet (for example `ESC`, `SHIFT+B`, `CTRL+SHIFT+S`, or the keys inside the playlist and meta editors). These cannot be rebound.

### `ALT` on macOS (`Option`)

This guide writes the modifier as `ALT` (`ALT+L`, `ALT+←` / `ALT+→`). On a Mac that is the **Option (⌥)** key: a macOS build of Mousiki shows `OPTION+L` / `OPTION+LEFT/RIGHT` in the cheat sheet and `[Option+←→]` in the playlist editor's legend, everything else is identical. Two things to know:

- **Terminal setting:** Terminals on macOS only pass Option through as a modifier if you tell them to. In *Terminal.app* tick **Settings → Profiles → Keyboard → "Use Option as Meta key"**; in *iTerm2* set **Settings → Profiles → Keys → Left Option key** to **Esc+**. Without it, Option+L types a special character (e.g. `¬`) that Mousiki never sees as a command. You can skip this setting: the lyrics timing overlay can also be opened (and closed) with `CTRL+L` on macOS and Linux, which needs no terminal setup. `OPTION+←` / `OPTION+→` (playlist tabs) work in Terminal.app and iTerm2 without it, because they send the standard word-movement codes.
- **Option+←/→** (playlist editor tab switch) is sent as `ESC b` / `ESC f` by Terminal.app and iTerm2 out of the box, and Mousiki understands both that and the xterm form, so it works without the setting above.

### Uppercase letters

Several commands use **Shift + letter** (`T`, `N`, `M`, `P`, `H`, `X`) because the plain lowercase letter already does something else. Where this guide writes `SHIFT+T`, it means the uppercase `T`.

### The main screen

The main screen has a **local/online/playlist list** on the left (titled `LOCAL AUDIO FILES`, `ONLINE RESULTS` or `SAVED PLAYLISTS`), a **Queue** panel, a metadata panel with lyrics or a visualizer, and a search box. Only one of the list or the queue has **focus** at a time. Focus decides where the arrow keys work (see `TAB` below).

**Window size.** The list and queue panes use every row the terminal has left under the metadata panel, progress bar and search box, so a maximised window is filled down to its last line. Resize at any time, also while a menu is open: Settings, Console, the playlist and meta editors and the listening history take the same height as the main screen, and the cheat sheet (`?`) uses the full terminal height. The playlist and meta editors keep a few rows at the bottom for their legend and status messages. The cheat sheet and the listening history keep no empty rows. The history shows a status message in a row of its own only while there is one.

### Play mode letter

The small box next to the search bar shows the current play mode as a letter: `L` list, `R` repeat, `S` shuffle, `O` stop, `Q` queue then stop.

## 1. System (main UI)

| Key | Action | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `s` | Open Settings | Opens the Settings panel (see [Settings](#10-settings-individual-tabs) for every tab). Inside Settings, pressing `s` again **saves to `config.txt` and returns** to the main screen. `ESC` or `q` returns **without saving right now** (see the Settings section for what that means). |
| `t` | Console / logs | Opens a read-only log view showing what the app has been doing (sort changes, filter changes, queue messages, load timings and so on). Close it with `ESC`, `t` or `T`. |
| `?` | Cheat sheet | Opens the command list. Use `↑`/`↓` to scroll (the list is longer than most terminal windows). Close with `?` or `ESC`. |
| `q` | Quit | Quits the application from the main screen. |
| `ESC` | Close / back | Closes whatever is open (Settings, an overlay, a menu, a prompt). On the **main screen** it returns to the *home view*: the full local library, with no search query and no folder filter, scrolled to the top. It does not change the sort mode. |
| `ENTER` | Confirm / select | Confirms the highlighted choice or starts the highlighted item. What it does depends on where you are (play a track, queue a playlist, commit a search and so on). |
| `ARROW KEYS` | Navigate | Move up and down through lists, left and right to seek or move a text caret. What they do depends on the current screen. |
| `Y` / `N` | Confirm or cancel a prompt | Answers Yes/No prompts such as "Want to clear queue?" or "Fetching metadata via AcoustID … Continue?". |

**Tips**

- Almost every overlay closes with `ESC`.
- Prompts swallow other keys while they are open, so nothing underneath can be triggered by accident.
**The cheat sheet (`?`)** is the screen this guide follows. The footer shows how far you have scrolled (`1/87`).

*The cheat sheet, opened with `?`. Scroll with `↑`/`↓`; `?` or `ESC` closes it.*

## 2. Playback (main UI)

The main screen while a track plays: the disk, the metadata panel, the visualizer and the lyrics area at the top, then the progress bar with its waveform, the volume bar, the search box, and the local file list and queue at the bottom. The box on the right of the search bar shows the play mode letter (here `S` for shuffle).

![Main screen with synchronized lyrics](images/Playback_Main_UI_lyrics.png)

*Main screen with the lyrics engine on: the lyrics fill the right-hand area.*

![Main screen with the lyric ball](images/Playback_Main_UI_lyric_ball.png)

*Main screen with no lyrics shown: the audio-reactive **lyric ball** (Settings → ON/OFF → Lyric Ball) fills the area instead.*


| Key | Action | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ENTER` | Play the selected track | Starts the highlighted track. Pressing it again on the same track reloads it. On a **playlist row** it does not play. It queues every track in that playlist instead. |
| `p` | Play / pause | Pauses or resumes the current track. |
| `n` | Next | Plays the next track. If the **queue** has items, the next queue item plays. Otherwise the next track in the list plays (relative to what is *playing*, not where your cursor is). A manual skip always skips, even in repeat or stop mode. |
| `b` | Previous | Plays the previous track in the list. There is no queue equivalent, because a queue that has been consumed has no meaningful "previous". |
| `#` | Shuffle next | A one-off jump to a **random track from the current list**. It ignores the queue on purpose and is independent of the shuffle play mode. |
| `m` | Cycle play mode | Steps through the five play modes (see below). |
| `→` | Seek forward | Jumps forward **5 seconds**. |
| `←` | Seek backward | Jumps back **5 seconds**. |
| `1` | Volume up | Raises the in-app volume in steps of 5 (up to 100). |
| `2` | Volume down | Lowers the in-app volume in steps of 5 (down to 0). |
| `x` | Mute | Sets the volume to 0 without pausing. Pressing it again restores the previous volume. |
| `v` | Toggle loudness normalization | Turns loudness normalization on or off, so you can compare a track with and without it. When turned on, the status line shows the track's measured loudness and the correction applied. The target and maximum boost are set with the `SHIFT+V` overlay (see *Loudness normalization overlay* below) or in `config.txt`. |
| `E` (Shift+E) | Equalizer | Opens the **10-band equalizer** overlay with presets. The sound changes live while you adjust it. See *Equalizer overlay* below. |


### Equalizer overlay (`SHIFT+E`)

Opens a window in the middle of the screen with a **10-band graphic equalizer**. Each band is a vertical slider from **−12 dB** to **+12 dB**, with the center line at 0 dB. The bands sit at **31, 62, 125, 250, 500 Hz, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 kHz**. The selected band is highlighted, and its gain and name are shown underneath. The top line of the window shows the current **preset**, whether the **EQ is ON or OFF**, and the **preamp** (see below). The key legend at the bottom of the window is drawn in the same color as the window's border.

The equalizer works on everything the player plays and changes the sound **while the music plays**, so you can adjust it by ear. Playback keeps running while the overlay is open, but its keys are the only ones that react until you close it. The overlay opens on every main screen.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `←` / `→` | Select the previous / next band (wraps around) |
| `↑` / `↓` | Raise / lower the selected band by 1 dB |
| `,` or `<` | Previous preset |
| `.` or `>` or `TAB` | Next preset (the built-in presets first, then your custom presets) |
| `0` | Set the selected band to 0 dB |
| `SPACE` | Switch the equalizer on / off. The gains stay as they are. |
| `R` | Reset all bands to **Flat**. The on / off state is not changed. |
| `S` | **Save** the current curve as a **custom preset**. A *Save as:* prompt opens under the sliders (see *Custom presets* below). |
| `DEL` or `X` | **Delete** the selected custom preset. Press it twice to confirm. |
| `ESC` or `SHIFT+E` | Close the overlay. The settings are **saved to `config.txt`** when it closes. |

**Switching on.** Moving a band or choosing a preset also turns the equalizer on, so what you change is always what you hear. Use `SPACE` to compare against the original sound.

**Presets.** The preset keys cycle through the list below in this order, and then through your own custom presets (see below), in the order you saved them. If the gains do not match any preset exactly (for example after you moved a band), the top line shows **Custom**. Stepping to the next or previous preset then continues from the last preset you used.

| Preset | Gains in dB, 31 Hz → 16 kHz |
|---|---|
| Flat | `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0` |
| Bass Boost | `+6, +5, +4, +2, +1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0` |
| Treble Boost | `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, +1, +2, +4, +5, +6` |
| Vocal | `-2, -3, -3, +1, +3, +4, +3, +2, 0, -1` |
| Rock | `+4, +3, +2, -1, -2, -1, +1, +3, +4, +4` |
| Pop | `-1, +1, +3, +4, +3, 0, -1, -1, -1, -1` |
| Jazz | `+3, +2, +1, +2, -2, -2, 0, +1, +2, +3` |
| Classical | `+4, +3, +3, +2, -1, -1, 0, +2, +3, +3` |
| Electronic | `+5, +4, +1, 0, -2, +2, +1, +1, +4, +5` |
| Hip-Hop | `+5, +4, +2, +3, -1, -1, +2, 0, +2, +3` |
| Acoustic | `+4, +4, +3, +1, +2, +2, +3, +3, +3, +2` |
| Loudness | `+6, +4, +1, 0, -1, -1, 0, +1, +4, +5` |

**Custom presets.** Shape the sliders the way you like, then press `S` to keep the curve as a preset of your own.

- A **Save as:** prompt replaces the line under the sliders and the legend changes to the prompt's keys. Type a name (up to **16 characters**) and press `ENTER` to save it, or `ESC` to cancel. Only the prompt closes on `ESC`; the equalizer stays open. The usual text keys work in the prompt: `←` / `→`, `HOME` / `END`, `SHIFT+←` / `SHIFT+→` to mark, and `CTRL+C` / `CTRL+X` / `CTRL+V`.
- The new preset is added **after the built-in presets** and appears on the top line under its name whenever the sliders match it. It is written to `config.txt` **immediately**, not only when the overlay closes.
- If you moved a band away from one of your custom presets, the prompt starts with that preset's name, so `ENTER` alone **updates** it. A name that already belongs to a custom preset (capital letters don't matter) **replaces** that preset.
- The names of the built-in presets and the word *Custom* cannot be used. The characters `=`, `{` and `}` are replaced by `-`, because the configuration file uses them. You can keep up to **24** custom presets.
- To **delete** one, select it with `,` / `.` so that the top line shows its name, press `DEL` (or `X`), and press it again within the overlay to confirm. Any other key cancels the deletion. The built-in presets cannot be deleted. The sliders keep their current values after a deletion and show **Custom**.
- Short messages such as *Saved "My Mix"*, *Updated "My Mix"* or *Deleted "My Mix"* appear on the line under the sliders and disappear with the next key press.

**Preamp.** Boosting bands makes the whole signal louder and can push it into distortion. The player therefore lowers the level automatically by the height of the loudest point of your curve. The **Preamp** value on the top line shows this (for example `-7.1 dB` for Bass Boost). The sound will be slightly quieter with a strong boost than without the equalizer, and that is intended. Raise the volume if you need it louder. The equalizer is bypassed completely when it is off or all bands are 0 dB.

**Good to know.**
- On a track with a low sample rate (22.05 kHz, for example) the top band is too close to the limit of the signal and is skipped.
- **Loudness normalization** (`v`) measures the track *before* the equalizer. With a strong boost or cut a track can therefore end up a little louder or quieter than the normalization target.
- The window is 21 rows high (15 on a terminal with fewer than 24 rows, see the next point), so it still fits on a 24-row terminal.
- On a terminal with fewer than 24 rows the sliders are drawn in steps of 4 dB instead of 2 dB, so the window fits. The gains themselves still change in steps of 1 dB.

![Equalizer overlay, main playback UI](images/Playback_Main_UI_EQUALIZER.png)

### The five play modes (`m`)

Each press moves to the next mode in this order: **list → repeat → shuffle → stop → queue then stop → list …**

| Mode | Letter | Behavior when a track finishes |
|---|---|---|
| List | `L` | Plays the next track in the list (the queue takes priority when it has items). |
| Repeat | `R` | Replays the same track again. |
| Shuffle | `S` | Plays a random track. If the queue has more than one item, a random queue item is chosen. |
| Stop | `O` | Plays the track and then stops, with no automatic advance. The "no track loaded" screen with the cassette is shown. |
| Queue then stop | `Q` | Plays the queue **once**, then stops. It never falls through to the library: when the queue is used up, playback ends (like Stop mode), also when the queue was empty to begin with and a library track finishes. With the queue **locked** (default) each item goes to the back as it is played and the pass ends after the last unplayed item, so the queue is back in its original order afterwards. Tracks you add during the pass (`a`, `e`, bulk add) still play before it ends. Unlocked, played items leave the queue and it stops when it is empty. `n` always skips on, also after the pass is over (it starts a new one). |

## 3. Navigation & view (main UI)

| Key | Action | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `↑` | Explore list up | Moves the highlight up in the focused panel (list or queue). |
| `↓` | Explore list down | Moves the highlight down in the focused panel. |
| `TAB` | Switch between panels | Moves focus between the **list** and the **queue**. This decides which panel the up/down arrows, `d` (remove), `4`/`5` (move) and `a` (add / bulk add) act on. |
| `f` | Filter by folder | Narrows the local list to the **folder of the highlighted track**. It also switches the sort back to *folder order*. The pane title then shows `sort: folder order, folder: <name> [c] clear`. The filter stacks on top of an active search. |
| `c` | Clear filter | Removes the folder filter. It leaves the sort mode alone. |
| `T` (Shift+T) | Cycle local list sort mode | Cycles the sort of the local list through three modes: **folder order → title A-Z → artist A-Z**. The current mode is shown in the pane title (see below). |
| `k` | Refresh UI | Forces a full redraw. Use it when a terminal resize or a switch of terminal session left the screen torn or stale. |
| `w` | Toggle waveform style | Switches the waveform between **raw** and **smooth**. |
| `+` | Cycle lyrics area | Cycles the lyrics area through three views: **lyrics → sphere → oscilloscope → lyrics …**. The two visuals are the lyrics engine's *off* states: no lyrics are fetched from the network while one of them is shown, and the choice is stored in the **Lyric Viz** setting. Coming back to the lyrics fetches them for the current track right away. |
| `N` (Shift+N) | Toggle metadata-only track list | Switches every list row between **filename** and **metadata title** (the embedded title tag). Files with no title tag, or whose tags have not been read yet, keep showing their filename. This also switches what "title A-Z" sorts by (see below). Also available in **Settings → ON/OFF**. |
| `l` | Retry lyrics | Opens a small form to fetch lyrics again with a **manual title and artist**. Use it when the automatic match was wrong. |
| `ALT+l` | Adjust lyrics | Opens a small overlay menu for live adjustment of the lyrics timing. |
| `O` (Shift+O) | Oscilloscope tuning | Opens a small overlay to change the oscilloscope's afterglow, line thickness and tail **live**. See *The oscilloscope* below. |
| `V` (Shift+V) | Normalization tuning | Opens a small overlay to switch loudness normalization on or off and to change its target level and maximum boost **live**. See *Loudness normalization overlay* below. |
| `Z` (Shift+Z) | Sleep timer | Opens a small overlay to pause playback after 15, 30, 60, 90 or 120 minutes, or to stop after the current song. See *Sleep timer overlay* below. |


### How the sort mode and `SHIFT+N` work together

The sort mode in the pane title always tells you what is being sorted on:

| Sort mode | Pane title shows | Sorted by |
|---|---|---|
| Folder order | `sort: folder order` | The order the files were found on disk |
| Title A-Z, `SHIFT+N` **off** | `sort: file name A-Z` | The file name |
| Title A-Z, `SHIFT+N` **on** | `sort: title A-Z` | The embedded title tag (falling back to the file name where there is none) |
| Artist A-Z | `sort: artist A-Z` | The artist tag (falling back to the artist guessed from the parent folder) |

Toggling `SHIFT+N` re-sorts the list immediately and keeps your cursor on the same track. In **metadata-only** mode the order can shift slightly right after startup, while the background scan is still reading tags.

A **search** always ranks by match quality, so while a query is active the sort mode is not used. It applies again once the query is cleared.

### How the lyrics form (`l`) works

| Key in the form | Function |
|---|---|
| `TAB` / `↓` | Next field |
| `↑` | Previous field |
| `SPACE` | Tick or untick a checkbox (slowed, ultra-slowed, sped up, reverb, remix, other). Slowed, ultra-slowed and sped up are mutually exclusive. |
| Typing | Fills the text fields |
| `ENTER` | Fetch lyrics with these settings (works from any field) |
| `ESC` | Cancel |

`l` only works while the lyrics engine is on (`+`).

![Better lyric form](images/Playback_Main_UI_lyrics_better.png)

### Lyrics timing overlay (`ALT+L`)

For tracks whose synced lyrics run ahead of or behind the music. The overlay shifts **all** lines (and, for word-synced lyrics, all words) of the playing track by the same amount. The change is visible **live** while the music plays, in the lyrics area and in the three lines shown in the overlay itself (previous, current and next line, with the current one highlighted). `ALT+L` opens only while synced lyrics are loaded for the track; otherwise the status line says so.

| Key | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `→` / `←` | Lyrics **later** / **earlier** by 0.1 s |
| `↑` / `↓` | Lyrics **later** / **earlier** by 0.5 s |
| `R` | Back to 0 (the timing as it is in the lyrics file) |
| `ENTER` or `S` | **Save** the offset into the track's lyrics file and close |
| `ESC` or `ALT+l` | Cancel: the offset from before the overlay was opened comes back |

- A **positive** offset (`+0.3 s`) means the lyrics appear later than their timestamps say, so use it when the lyrics are **too early**. A negative offset makes them appear earlier. The range is ±30 s.
- Saving writes a standard `[offset:...]` tag at the top of the track's `.lrc` file (in the `lyrics` folder next to the track, in milliseconds, with the usual LRC sign convention: positive = earlier). The timestamps themselves are not changed. The offset is read back whenever the lyrics are loaded from that file, and other players that know the tag use it too. Saving `0` removes the tag.
- The offset belongs to **one track's lyrics file**. Fetching the lyrics again with `l` (retry) replaces the file and resets the offset. If there is no lyrics file for the track, the offset still applies until the track changes, but saving reports that it could not be saved.
- Playback keeps running while the overlay is open; only its keys react.

![Lyric offset editor overlay](images/Playlist_menu_LYRIC_OFFSET_EDITOR.png)

### The oscilloscope (lyric visual)

When there are no lyrics to show (lyrics engine off, nothing found, or the fetch is still running) the lyrics area is filled by a **lyric visual**. With Settings → ON/OFF → **Lyric Viz** set to `osci` (or after pressing `+` to the oscilloscope view) that visual is an **XY oscilloscope** instead of the sphere.

**How it draws.** Like a real scope in X-Y mode, the **left channel moves the beam horizontally and the right channel moves it vertically**. A track with a wide stereo image fills the area with a cloud, a pure tone with a phase shift between the channels draws an ellipse, and out-of-phase material leans the other way. The picture is drawn into the largest centred square of the lyrics area, so circles stay circles. A quiet track is boosted automatically, so it still fills the area.

**Mono tracks.** In a true XY scope a mono signal (left = right) can only draw a diagonal line. When a track is (nearly) mono, the scope therefore fades over to a *phase portrait* of the signal instead (the signal against its own rate of change), which draws loops and circles whose shape follows the sound. The switch is smooth, so a track hovering near the limit does not flicker.

**Look.** The trace is drawn with smooth, anti-aliased lines. Like the phosphor of an old oscilloscope it leaves a short **afterglow** that fades out, and the newest part of the trace is brighter than the oldest. The colour is the **VIZ** gradient (Settings → Colors → VIZ) running left to right, dimmed where the beam is weaker, so the fading trail also fades in colour.

### Oscilloscope tuning overlay (`SHIFT+O`)

Opens a small window in the middle of the screen where the three look settings can be changed **while the music plays**. It is deliberately small and sits clear of the lyrics area, so you can watch the scope while you adjust it.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` / `↓` | Select a value (wraps around) |
| `←` / `→` | Decrease / increase the selected value |
| `R` | Reset all three values to their defaults |
| `ESC` or `SHIFT+O` | Close the overlay. The values are **saved to `config.txt`** when it closes. |

Playback keeps running while the overlay is open, but its keys are the only ones that react until you close it. The overlay opens on every main screen. If **Lyric Viz** is set to `sphere`, it shows a hint, because the values only affect the oscilloscope.

| Value | Range | Step | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Decay | 0.00 – 0.99 | 0.01 | 0.80 | The **afterglow**. Each frame the picture is dimmed by this factor, so higher values leave longer trails. `0.00` shows only the current trace. Values near `0.99` smear for a long time. |
| Dot threshold | 0.01 – 1.00 | 0.01 | 0.28 | How bright a point must be before it is drawn. **Lower** values give a thicker, softer line with a long visible fade. **Higher** values give a thin, sharp core, but fast parts of the trace can break into gaps. |
| Tail | 0.00 – 1.00 | 0.02 | 0.45 | The brightness of the **oldest** part of the trace compared with the newest (`1.00`). Low values give a comet with a bright head and a fading tail, `1.00` makes the trace uniformly bright. |

Two starting points: for a crisp, "real oscilloscope" look try Decay `0.65`, Dot threshold `0.35`, Tail `0.60`. For a glowing, dreamy look try `0.90`, `0.20`, `0.25`.

![The oscillator parameter overlay menu next to the oscillator itself](images/Playback_Main_UI_OSCI_MENU.png)

### Loudness normalization overlay (`SHIFT+V`)

Opens a small window in the middle of the screen where loudness normalization can be switched on and off and tuned **while the music plays**. What you change is what you hear: the level glides to the new value within about a second, so there is no click. (The plain `v` key still toggles normalization on and off without opening anything.)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` / `↓` | Select a row (wraps around) |
| `←` / `→` | On the **Normalize** row: switch off / on. On the other two rows: decrease / increase the value by 1. |
| `SPACE` or `v` | Switch normalization on / off from any row |
| `R` | Reset **Target level** and **Max boost** to their defaults. The on / off state is not changed. |
| `ESC` or `SHIFT+V` | Close the overlay. The values are **saved to `config.txt`** when it closes. |

Playback keeps running while the overlay is open, but its keys are the only ones that react until you close it. The overlay opens on every main screen.

| Row | Range | Step | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Normalize | off / on | | on | Loudness normalization on or off. Same switch as the `v` key and **Settings → ON/OFF → Normalize Volume**. |
| Target level | -40 – 0 LUFS | 1 | -16 | The loudness every track is measured against and played at. `-16` leaves more headroom, `-14` matches YouTube and Spotify. A lower number is quieter overall. |
| Max boost | 0 – 24 dB | 1 | 9 | The most a quiet track may be raised. Loud or heavily compressed tracks are lowered regardless. |

**Live line.** Below the three rows a grey line shows what is happening with the track that is playing right now: its measured loudness and the gain that is applied to it (`+` = raised, `-` = lowered). If a quiet track would need more than **Max boost**, the applied gain stops at that limit, so this line is the quickest way to see whether the boost limit is holding a track back. For the first seconds of a track it shows *measuring loudness* until enough audio has been analysed.

![Loudness normalization overlay](images/Playlist_menu_NORM_OVERLAY.png)

### Sleep timer overlay (`SHIFT+Z`)

A small overlay for falling asleep to music. Playback keeps running while it is open.

| Key | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `↑` / `↓` | Pick an entry: **15 / 30 / 60 / 90 / 120 minutes**, **Stop after current song**, or **Off**. |
| `ENTER` | Set the picked entry and close the overlay. Picking the running minute entry again restarts its countdown. |
| `ESC` or `SHIFT+Z` | Close the overlay without changing anything. |

- While a timer is armed the remaining time (or `after song`) is shown in the title of the search bar, e.g. `SEARCH LOCAL  [SLEEP 24:10]`.
- When a minute timer runs out, playback is **paused**, not stopped: the position is kept and `p` resumes it.
- **Stop after current song** ends playback when the song that is playing ends, even if the queue still has tracks or the play mode is Repeat. It needs a playing song to attach to.
- The two kinds of timer exclude each other: setting one replaces the other. The timer is **not saved** and is gone after a restart.
- **Stop play mode:** the sleep timer never changes the play mode (`m`). *Stop after current song* is a one-shot on top of it, so with the Stop mode already on it is simply redundant, and your play mode is unchanged afterwards.

## 4. Search (main UI)

| Key | Action | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Search local folder | Opens the search box. The list updates **live as you type**. Press `ENTER` to keep the result, or `ESC` to cancel and restore the previous view. |
| `/s:` + query | Search online (YouTube) | Type `s:` followed by your query, then press `ENTER`. Online searches only run on `ENTER`, never per keystroke. |
| `/p:` + query | Search saved playlists | Type `p:` followed by part of a playlist name. The playlist list filters live. `ENTER` on a playlist row queues all of its tracks. |
| `/f:` + query | Search folders | Type `f:` followed by part of a folder name (or of `<parent folder> <folder>`, e.g. `beatles abbey`). The folder list filters live. `ENTER` on a folder row opens it in the LOCAL AUDIO FILES pane and lists all of its files, exactly like the `f` filter (`c` clears it again). |
| `L` (Shift+L) | Big list overlay | Floats a larger version of the list pane (LOCAL AUDIO FILES) over the main UI. See below. |


**Local search details**

- The search is **fuzzy**. For example "X Files" also finds "X-Files".
- It matches the file name, the artist, the embedded title tag and the album tag. Files whose tags have not been read yet can still be found by file name.
- Results are ranked purely by match quality, best first.
- While the search box is open, `↑`/`↓` move through the live preview. `←`/`→` move the text caret, and `SHIFT+←/→` marks text.
- A folder filter (`f`) keeps applying to search results.

### Big list overlay (`SHIFT+L`)

Opens a large window, styled like the lyrics form (`l`), that shows the same list as the small pane (LOCAL AUDIO FILES, or the online / playlist results) with many more rows. It shares the cursor with the small pane, so both always point at the same track.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SHIFT+↓` / `SHIFT+↑` | Next / previous **page** (faster scrolling). At the end of the list the cursor jumps to the last / first entry. |
| `↑` / `↓` | Move one row |
| `ESC` or `SHIFT+L` | Close the overlay |

Everything else keeps working from inside the overlay: `ENTER` plays, `T` cycles the sort mode, `f` / `c` set / clear the folder filter, `/` searches (the search bar is part of the overlay), `a` adds to the queue, `n` / `b` / `p` / seek / volume as usual, and `l` opens the lyrics form on top of it. The queue pane is hidden while the overlay is open, so its footer shows the current queue size (`queue: N`) together with a page counter. Full-screen menus (Settings, Playlists, ...) hide the overlay while they are open and it returns when they close.

![Big list overlay](images/Playback_Main_UI_TRACK_OVERLAY.png)

*Big list overlay can be open via `SHIFT+l` and closed via the same command or `ESC`. Fast scrolling (scroll per page) is possible via `SHIFT+↑/↓`.*

## 5. Queue (main UI)

The queue is a list of tracks that play **before** the normal list continues. Press `TAB` to move focus into the queue panel when you want the arrow keys or `d`, `4`, `5`, `SHIFT+4`, `SHIFT+5` to work on it.

| Key | Action | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `a` | Add hovering track as **next** | With the **list** focused, puts the highlighted track at the **front** of the queue, so it plays next. Pressing `a` on several tracks in a row keeps their order: A, B, C play as A, B, C. On a playlist row it queues all of the playlist's tracks at the end instead. With the **queue** focused, `a` opens the **bulk-add** panel (see below). |
| `e` | Add hovering track to the **end** | With the **list** focused, adds the highlighted track to the end of the queue. On a playlist row it queues the whole playlist at the end. With the queue focused it only reminds you to focus the list first. |
| `d` | Remove hovering track from queue | Removes the highlighted queue item. Focus the queue with `TAB` first. |
| `4` | Move hovering queue item up | Moves the highlighted queue item one place up. Focus the queue first. |
| `5` | Move hovering queue item down | Moves the highlighted queue item one place down. Focus the queue first. |
| `$` (Shift+4) | Move to top | Moves the highlighted queue item to the very top of the queue. |
| `%` (Shift+5) | Move to bottom | Moves the highlighted queue item to the very bottom of the queue. |
| `!` | Lock / unlock the queue | The queue is **locked by default**: a played track moves to the end of the queue. Unlocked, it leaves the queue. See *Locked queue* below. |
| `X` (Shift+X) | Clear the whole queue | Asks "Want to clear queue?" first. See below. |
| `CTRL+SHIFT+Z` | Undo the last queue clear | Brings back the queue that `SHIFT+X` cleared. See *Undo clear* below. |
| `CTRL+SHIFT+U` | Queue to playlist | Saves the queue's local tracks as a playlist. See *Queue to playlist* below. |
| `K` (Shift+K) | Big queue overlay | Floats a larger version of the QUEUE pane over the main UI. See below. |


### Big queue overlay (`SHIFT+K`)

The same idea as the big list overlay, for the queue: a large window that shows the QUEUE pane with many more rows. It is on `SHIFT+K` (and not on `q`) so that you cannot quit the app by accident. It shares the cursor with the small queue pane, and the queue is automatically focused while it is open, so the arrow keys move through the queue.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SHIFT+ARROW_DOWN` / `SHIFT+ARROW_UP` | Next / previous **page**. At the end the cursor jumps to the last / first entry. |
| `ARROW_UP` / `ARROW_DOWN` | Move one row |
| `4` / `5` (default) | Move the hovered track up / down in the queue |
| `SHIFT+4` / `SHIFT+5` (default) | Move the hovered track to the top / bottom of the queue |
| `!` (default) | Lock / unlock the queue |
| `d` | Remove the hovered track from the queue |
| `a` | Open the bulk-add panel (paste a playlist link), as with the queue focused |
| `SHIFT+X` | Clear the whole queue (asks first) |
| `CTRL+SHIFT+Z` | Undo the last queue clear |
| `CTRL+SHIFT+U` | Save the queue as a playlist (opens the playlist editor) |
| `ESC` or `SHIFT+K` | Close the overlay (the previous focus is restored) |

Only one of the two overlays can be open at a time: `SHIFT+K` while the list overlay is open switches to the queue overlay, and vice versa. Pressing `/` closes the queue overlay, because the search filters the list underneath. Playback keys (`n`, `b`, `p`, seek, volume) keep working. The bottom border of the frame shows the page counter and the number of tracks. All commands of the overlay are listed in a gray **legend below the frame** (`[d] delete`, `[SHIFT+X] clear all`, `[4/5] move up/down`, `[SHIFT+4/5] move to top/bottom`, `[!] lock` / `[!] unlock`, `[CTRL+SHIFT+U] queue to playlist`, `[CTRL+SHIFT+Z] undo clear`, `[SHIFT+UP/DOWN] page`, `[ESC] close`).

![Big list overlay](images/Playback_Main_UI_QUEUE_OVERLAY.png)

*Big list overlay can be open via `SHIFT+l` and closed via the same command or `ESC`. Fast scrolling (scroll per page) is possible via `SHIFT+↑/↓`.*

### Locked queue (`!`)

The queue is **locked by default**. A locked queue keeps all its tracks: when a track is played (by auto-advance or by `n`) it **moves to the end of the queue**, so the queue loops instead of draining, and the next track is always the one at the top (in shuffle mode a random queue item is picked and sent to the end). `d` and `SHIFT+X` still remove tracks, locking only stops tracks from disappearing by themselves. The panel title shows `QUEUE (locked)`.

Press `!` to **unlock**: a track then **leaves the queue** once it is played, and the queue runs empty. Press `!` again to lock it. The lock state is part of the saved session, so a session saved by an older version keeps the state it was saved with (press `!` once if it comes back unlocked). The play modes do not change this, with one exception: in `Q` (queue then stop) a locked queue is played through once and playback then stops instead of looping.

### Undo clear (`CTRL+SHIFT+Z`)

Brings back the queue that was cleared last with `SHIFT+X`. The restored tracks go in **front of** anything that was queued after the clear. There is **one** level of undo: after it is used (or before anything was cleared) the status line says that there is nothing to undo.

### Queue to playlist (`CTRL+SHIFT+U`)

Opens the playlist editor (see [Playlists](#6-playlists)) with the queue's tracks already in the new playlist and the **name field focused**: type a name and press `HOME` to save (the editor stays open, `ESC` leaves it). Playlists hold local files only, so **online (streamed) queue items are left out** and counted in the status line; duplicate files are added once. With an empty queue, or a queue with online tracks only, nothing opens and the status line says so.

### Clear queue prompt (`SHIFT+X`)

The prompt starts on **No**, so an accidental `ENTER` never wipes the queue.

| Key | Result |
|---|---|
| `←` | Highlight Yes |
| `→` | Highlight No |
| `TAB` | Toggle between Yes and No |
| `ENTER` | Take the highlighted answer |
| `y` | Yes: clear the queue |
| `n`, `ESC` or any other key | No: cancel |

If the queue is already empty, the status line just says so. A cleared queue can be brought back with `CTRL+SHIFT+Z` (see above).

### Bulk add (`a` with the queue focused)

Paste a YouTube playlist link to queue tracks from it.

1. **Type or paste the link** and press `ENTER` to fetch it (`ESC` cancels).
2. Once the results appear: `↑`/`↓` move, `SPACE` stars or unstars a row, `a` queues **all** of them, and `ENTER` queues **only the starred** ones.
3. `ESC` throws everything away.

---

## 6. Playlists

`P` (Shift+P) opens the **playlist editor**, a full-screen overlay for building playlists from your local (or downloaded) tracks. It has two tabs: **Create/Edit** and **Saved Playlists**. Playlists are used from the main screen with `/p:` (see [Search](#4-search-main-ui)).

![Playlist editor, Create / Edit tab](images/Playlist_menu_CREATE_EDIT_TAB.png)

***Create / Edit** tab: the name field, the library picker with its search (`/`), and the tracks of the playlist being built.*

![Playlist editor, Saved Playlists tab](images/Playlist_menu_SAVED_PLAYLISTS.png)

***Saved Playlists** tab: the search field and the list of saved playlists with their track counts.*


| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| `P` | Open Playlists (create / manage) |
| `ALT+←` / `ALT+→` | Switch between the Create/Edit tab and the Saved Playlists tab. Alt is used because plain arrows are needed for the text fields. |
| `TAB` | Cycle focus. On Create/Edit: name field → library picker → track list. On Saved Playlists: search box ↔ list. |
| `↑` / `↓` | Move through the focused list or picker |
| `ENTER` | Depends on focus. See the table below. |
| `4` / `5` | Move the highlighted track up or down in the playlist you are building |
| `D` / `DEL` / `BACKSPACE` | Remove the highlighted track (track list focused). On the Saved Playlists tab, `DEL` deletes the selected playlist after a Yes/No confirmation. |
| `HOME` / `Fn + ←` | Save the playlist |
| `SHIFT+←` / `SHIFT+→` | Mark text in the name and search fields |
| `CTRL+C` / `CTRL+X` / `CTRL+V` | Copy, cut and paste text in those fields |

### What `ENTER` does in the playlist editor

| Where | Result |
|---|---|
| Name field | Confirms the name and jumps to the library picker |
| Library picker | Adds the highlighted track to the playlist. (Typing in this pane filters the library live.) |
| Saved Playlists, search box | Moves focus to the list |
| Saved Playlists, list | Loads the selected playlist into the editor |

### Leaving

`ESC` closes the editor. If there are unsaved changes on the Create/Edit tab, it asks whether to save: `y` saves, `n` discards and leaves, `ESC` cancels the question and keeps editing.

---

## 7. Meta editor

`M` (Shift+M) opens the **meta/tag editor** for changing a file's **file name**, **artist**, **title**, **album** and **year**, and for looking up missing tags with AcoustID (an audio-fingerprint service).

**Important safety rules**

- Editing never touches your files directly. All changes go into a **pending edit session**, which is autosaved after every keystroke to `~/.cache/mousiki/meta_session/`. Closing the editor, quitting, or even a crash keeps the session.
- Touched fields and the matching library rows are drawn in the **header colour**, so you can see what will be written.
- Only `CTRL+SHIFT+S` writes to the files, and it asks first.

![Meta editor, Edit tab](images/Meta_Data_Editor_EDIT_TAB.png)

***Edit** tab: the search field, the library on the left, and the five fields (FILE, ARTIST, TITLE, ALBUM, YEAR) of the highlighted file on the right. The footer lists every key.*

![Meta editor, Fetch List tab](images/Meta_Data_Editor_FETCH_LIST_TAB.png)

***Fetch List** tab: the titles queued for an AcoustID lookup. The status line below the footer confirms what was added.*


| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| `M` | Open the meta editor |
| `←` / `→` | Switch between the **Edit** tab and the **Fetch List** tab. (While you are typing in a field, they move the text caret instead.) |
| `TAB` | Cycle panels on the Edit tab: search field → library → field editor |
| `↑` / `↓` | Move through the focused list, or between the five fields in the field editor |
| `ENTER` | Depends on focus (see below). On the **Fetch List** tab it fetches metadata for the whole list. |
| `SHIFT+←` / `SHIFT+→` | Mark text in the field editor |
| `CTRL+C` / `CTRL+X` / `CTRL+V` | Copy, cut, paste in the field editor |
| `a` | Add the highlighted file to the **fetch list** (library focused) |
| `r` | Toggle **edited files on top** of the library pane |
| `x` | Filter the library to files missing **any** metadata (library pane focused; press again to clear) |
| `SHIFT+T` | Filter the library to files missing a **title** (press again to clear) |
| `SHIFT+A` | Filter the library to files missing an **artist** (press again to clear) |
| `SHIFT+Y` | Filter the library to files missing a **year** (press again to clear) |
| `SHIFT+B` | Fetch metadata for the highlighted title via AcoustID (asks first) |
| `DEL` / `d` | Remove the highlighted title from the **fetch list**. It only takes a title off that list: it never deletes the file and does not touch pending edits. If the title is not on the fetch list, the status line says `not on the fetch list`. |
| `CTRL+SHIFT+S` | Apply all pending edits to the files (asks first) |
| `CTRL+SHIFT+X` | Discard all pending edits (asks first) |
| `ESC` | Close the editor (the session is kept) |

### What `ENTER` does in the meta editor

| Where | Result |
|---|---|
| Search field | Keeps the filter and moves to the library list |
| Library list | Starts editing the highlighted file's fields |
| Field editor | Finishes editing this field and goes back to the library |
| Fetch List tab | Fetch metadata for every title in the list (asks first) |

### Using the AcoustID lookup

- `SHIFT+B` looks up one title. It works from the meta editor and also directly from the **main list** (only for local files).
- `a` collects titles into the fetch list, and `ENTER` on the Fetch List tab runs them as a batch.
- Before anything is fetched you get the disclaimer that the result is not always accurate and previous metadata will be overwritten. Answer with `y`, `n` or `ESC`.
- Results only land in the **edit session**, never directly in the files. Low-confidence matches are reported as "no match" rather than written as wrong tags.
- Applying (`CTRL+SHIFT+S`) writes the tags without re-encoding the audio. A file name edit becomes a plain rename.

---

## 8. History

`H` (Shift+H) opens the **listening history** overlay, with three tabs. Nothing you do here changes your music.

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| `H` | Open the history (and close it again). `ESC` and `q` also close it. |
| `1` / `2` / `3` | Jump to the tab: **1 History**, **2 Top Tracks**, **3 Habits** |
| `←` / `→` / `TAB` | Move between tabs (on Top Tracks, `TAB` switches panes instead, see below) |
| `↑` / `↓` | Move the cursor in History and Top Tracks. On Habits they scroll. |
| `r` | On **Top Tracks**: flip between *most played first* and *least played first* |
| `TAB` | On **Top Tracks**: switch between the track list and the **ADD TOP TRACKS TO QUEUE** pane |
| `ENTER` | In the ADD TOP TRACKS TO QUEUE pane: queue the top 10 / 25 / 50 / 100 tracks (whichever is selected with `↑`/`↓`) |

### The three tabs

- **History**: the last 100 plays.
- **Top Tracks**: one row per title with its length and play count, sorted by play count.
- **Habits**: listening statistics, including average session length, listening time per day, tracks per session, skips, replays and completion rates.

![History tab](images/Listening_history_HISTORY_TAB.png)

***History** tab: when each track was played, its title, its length and its state (`PLAY` = playing now, `done` = played to the end, `skip` = skipped).*

![Top Tracks tab](images/Listening_history_TOP_TRACKS_TAB.png)

***Top Tracks** tab: titles by play count, with the **ADD TOP TRACKS TO QUEUE** pane underneath.*

![Habits tab](images/Listening_history_HABITS_TAB.png)

***Habits** tab: sessions, time played per day, and play behaviour.*


### Adding top tracks to the queue

1. Press `2` for Top Tracks.
2. Press `TAB` to move to the lower pane.
3. Use `↑`/`↓` to pick 10, 25, 50 or 100.
4. Press `ENTER`.

"Top N" always means the **N most-played titles**, even if you flipped the list with `r`. Files that have been moved or deleted since they were played are skipped, and the status line reports how many were queued and how many were missing. Online tracks are queued as online tracks.

---

## 9. Downloads

| Key | Action | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `y` | Save stream | Saves the **currently playing streamed track** into your download folder (**Settings → Paths → Download Folder**, or `~/.cache/mousiki` if none is set). The file is named `Title - Artist.ext`, the cached copy is removed, and the library refreshes so the file appears as a local track. |

Status messages:

- `saved to <path>`: success
- `already saved: <name>`: a file with that name is already in the folder
- `not a cached stream`: the current track is a regular local file, so there is nothing to download

---

## 10. Settings (individual tabs)

Press `s` on the main screen to open **Settings**. It has six tabs: **COLORS**, **ON/OFF**, **ANIMATION**, **PATHS**, **REFERENCE** and **ABOUT APP**. The footer shows `[TAB] Switch | [↑↓←→] Navigate/Cycle | [ENTER] Edit | [S] Save | [Q] Quit`, and the status line below it reports what just changed.

### Moving around and editing (all tabs)

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| `TAB` | Next tab (wraps from ABOUT APP back to COLORS). The cursor returns to the first row. |
| `↑` / `↓` | Previous or next row. On ABOUT APP they scroll the text. |
| `←` / `→` | On a row with a fixed list of values (switches, sliders, choices), steps through the values and applies the change **immediately**. On COLORS they move between the first and second cell of a row instead. |
| `ENTER` | Edits the value in place as free text. Not available on ABOUT APP or on the read-only rows of REFERENCE. On PATHS it edits the selected path, or adds one on a `+ new path` row. |
| `s` | **Saves to `config.txt` and returns** to the main screen. |
| `ESC` / `q` | Returns to the main screen without writing `config.txt` at that moment. |

**Good to know**

- Every change is **live**. It takes effect as soon as you make it.
- The configuration is also written to `config.txt` **whenever you quit the app normally**. `ESC`/`q` therefore only skips the immediate save. The changes still apply for the session and are lost only if the app is killed before it can quit normally.
- **Text editing** (after `ENTER`): `←`/`→` move the caret, `SHIFT+←/→` mark text, `HOME`/`END` jump, `DEL`/`BACKSPACE` delete, `CTRL+C/X/V` copy, cut and paste. `ENTER` confirms, `ESC` cancels and discards the edit. Ordinary fields hold up to 18 characters, folder paths up to 240.

### Tab 1: COLORS

![Settings, Colors tab](images/Settings_COLORS_TAB.png)

*The COLORS tab with the live preview on the right.*


Sets the colours of the interface. There are **15 rows**, each with a name, one or two value cells, and a **live preview** on the right.

**Values** are numbers from the 256-colour terminal palette (`1`–`255`). `0` or an empty field means "no colour", so the terminal's own default is used. Values in the ranges 30–47 and 90–107 are used as direct terminal colour codes.

| Row | First cell | Second cell | What it colours |
|---|---|---|---|
| BORDER_COLOR | TOP | BOTTOM | The frame lines, fading from top to bottom. |
| DISK | TOP | BOTTOM | The spinning disk (gradient). |
| METADATA | KEY | VAL | The labels and the values in the metadata panel. |
| VIZ | LEFT | RIGHT | The visualizer bars (gradient). |
| PROGRESS_BAR | PLAYED | PENDING | The played and the remaining part of the progress bar. |
| LIST | INACTIVE FG | BG | Ordinary rows of the track list (text / background). |
| | PLAYING FG | BG | The row of the track that is playing. |
| | CURSOR FG | BG | The highlighted (hovering) row. |
| QUEUE | INACTIVE FG | BG | Ordinary rows of the queue. |
| | PLAYING FG | BG | The queue row that is playing. |
| | CURSOR FG | BG | The highlighted queue row. |
| LYRICS | INACTIVE FG | BG | Lyric lines that are not active. |
| | ACTIVE L FG | BG | The active line. |
| | ACTIVE W FG | BG | The active word. |
| HEADER | TEXT | none | The section titles in Paths and Reference. Text colour only, no background. |
| LEGEND | TEXT | none | The key command legends: the hint lines such as `[ESC] close` at the bottom of the Settings, the big list and queue overlays (`SHIFT+L` / `SHIFT+K`), the playlist editor, the meta editor and the listening history, plus the small `< ↔ >` and note hints inside the Settings. Text colour only, no background. Default `90` (the grey they have always had), `0` = the terminal's own text colour. Also available as `ColorLegend=` in `config.txt`. |

`FG` is the text colour, `BG` the background. Use `←`/`→` to pick the cell, then `ENTER` to type a new number.

### Tab 2: ON/OFF

![Settings, ON/OFF tab](images/Settings_ON_OFF_TAB.png)

*The ON/OFF tab: a list of switches. (The folder settings are on the PATHS tab.)*


This tab is a list of **switches** (change them with `←`/`→`). Most are true/false, but **Lyric Viz** picks between `sphere` and `osci`. The folder settings (LOCAL PATH, DOWNLOAD FOLDER, PLAYLIST PATH) are on the **PATHS** tab.

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| Eliment Disk | Shows or hides the spinning disk in the player area. |
| Dummy Buttons | Shows or hides the three decorative buttons next to the progress bar. |
| Queue Display | Shows or hides the Queue panel. |
| WaveForm | Shows or hides the waveform. With it off, a plain bar is drawn instead. |
| Lyrics Engine | Turns lyric fetching and display on or off. `+` also switches this: it cycles lyrics (on) → sphere (off) → oscilloscope (off). |
| Lyric Viz | Which visual fills the lyrics area while a track is loaded and there are no lyrics to show: `sphere` (the audio-reactive ball) or `osci` (the XY oscilloscope, see *The oscilloscope* above). Both are drawn in the **VIZ** colors (Settings → Colors → VIZ). Replaces the old *Lyric Ball* on/off switch. The oscilloscope's look is tuned with `SHIFT+O`. |
| Visualizer | Shows or hides the spectrum visualizer. |
| Stereo Sound | On plays in stereo (about twice the memory per loaded track), off folds left and right into mono. Turning it **off** is immediate. Turning it **on** applies from the next track. |
| Normalize Volume | Loudness normalization on or off. Same as the `v` key. Target and boost are set with the `SHIFT+V` overlay. |
| Show meta data only | Rows show the embedded title tag instead of the file name. Same as `SHIFT+N`. The list is re-sorted straight away. |

### Tab 3: ANIMATION

![Settings, Animation tab](images/Settings_ANIMATION_TAB.png)

*The ANIMATION tab. The `< ↔ >` hint shows that `←`/`→` cycle the value.*


All rows are cycled with `←`/`→` (or typed after `ENTER`).

| Setting | Values | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Vis. Fluidity | 1–10 | How the visualizer bars **rise**. It affects only the rising motion. |
| Waveform Style | raw, smooth | Waveform drawing style. Same as the `w` key. |
| Disk Speed | 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.17, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00 | How fast the disk spins. |
| Playback Mode | list, loop, shuffle, stop, queue then stop | The play mode. Same as the `m` key (`loop` is the mode shown as *repeat*). |
| Vis. Degradation | 1–10 | How quickly bars **fall**. `1` is a slow, VU-meter-like fade, `10` a near-instant cutoff. |
| Vis. Viscosity | 1–10 | How strongly the bar motion is damped and smoothed between neighbouring bars. |
| Lyrics Alignment | left, center, right | Where lyric lines sit in their area. |
| Lyrics Animation | full, word by word, line by line, letter by letter, active line only, active word only | How lyrics are revealed and highlighted as the song plays. |

### Tab 4: PATHS

*The PATHS tab: the folders Mousiki reads music from, downloads to and keeps playlists in. (There is no screenshot for this tab yet.)*

Three sections, each under its own header. Move onto a row and press `ENTER` to edit it. The tab scrolls with the cursor, so a short terminal is fine.

| Section | Rows | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| LOCAL PATH | `Local Path 1`, `2`, … plus `+ new path` | The folders scanned for music. `ENTER` edits one. `+ new path` (`ENTER`) adds an empty line and opens it for typing. Committing a change **rescans the library immediately**. |
| DOWNLOAD FOLDER | one row | Where `y` (Save stream) puts downloaded tracks. Until you set one it shows the default cache folder (`~/.cache/mousiki`). It is added to the scanned folders automatically, so you do not repeat it as a local path. |
| PLAYLIST PATH | `Playlist Path 1`, `2`, … plus `+ new path` | The folders playlists are loaded from. **All** of them are searched. New playlists are saved and deleted in the **first** one. If none is set, the first local path plus `/playlists` is used. |

Paths accept `~` and `%USERPROFILE%` shortcuts, and both slash directions on Windows. Emptying a path line and pressing `ENTER` removes that path. (These sections used to be on the ON/OFF tab.)

### Tab 5: REFERENCE

![Settings, Reference tab](images/Settings_REFERENCE_TAB.png)

*The REFERENCE tab: the rebindable hotkeys (scroll for the rest).*

The longest tab. It scrolls as one list and has two parts: the hotkeys, then the font map.

**Hotkeys** (editable). A grey note at the top points to the cheat sheet (`?`), and the rebindable commands are listed under the headers PLAYBACK, NAVIGATION & VIEW, SEARCH, QUEUE, PLAYLISTS, META EDITOR, HISTORY, DOWNLOADS and SYSTEM. Each row shows a label and the key currently bound to it.

- Press `ENTER` on a row, type the new key, and press `ENTER` again.
- A key is written as the character itself (`n`, `T`, `#`, `+`) or as a name: `ENTER`, `TAB`, `SPACE`, `ESC`, `BACKSPACE`, `ARROW_KEY_UP`, `ARROW_KEY_DOWN`, `ARROW_KEY_LEFT`, `ARROW_KEY_RIGHT`.
- If the key is **already used by another action**, the change is refused with `KEY "x" ALREADY USED BY <action> -- try another key`, and you can type another one.
- The search prefixes (`/`, `/s:`, `/p:`) appear here too and are edited the same way.
- Keys that are **not** rebindable (`ESC`, `SHIFT+B`, the playlist and meta editors' own keys, `CTRL+SHIFT+S/X`, `CTRL+SHIFT+Z/U`, `ALT+l`) are not listed. The cheat sheet shows those.

**FONT / CHARACTER MAP** (read-only). Shows the `A = A, a` table from `config.txt`, which lets you re-font the interface with fancy Unicode letters without changing the terminal font. It cannot be edited here. Edit the `font_en={ … }` block in `config.txt` while the app is closed.

### Settings that exist (only) in `config.txt`

| Key in `config.txt` | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ReplaceEmoji` | `true` draws an emoji in a title as a single `?` so box borders stay aligned. `false` draws the real emoji. |
| `ConsoleVerbosity` | `basic` logs every command the app runs and its raw output. `verbose` adds internal and OS-level events. |
| `AutoSave` | Resumes the exact song, position, queue and play mode at the next launch. |
| `AutoSaveIndicator`, `AutoSaveChr`, `AutoSaveIndicatorType`, `AutoSaveC1`, `AutoSaveC2` | The small autosave indicator: whether it shows, its character, `blink` or `color` style, and the two pulse colours. |
| `OsciDecay`, `OsciDotThreshold`, `OsciTailBrightness` | The oscilloscope's afterglow (0.00 – 0.99), dot threshold (0.01 – 1.00) and tail brightness (0.00 – 1.00). Normally changed with the `SHIFT+O` overlay, which writes them here. Values outside the range are limited to it when the file is loaded. |
| `NormalizeVolume`, `NormalizeTargetLufs`, `NormalizeMaxBoostDb` | Loudness normalization on or off, its target level (-40 to 0 LUFS, default -16) and the most a quiet track may be raised (0 to 24 dB, default 9). Normally changed with the `SHIFT+V` overlay, which writes them here. Values outside the range are limited to it when the file is loaded. |
| `AutoSaveDelayInSec` | How often the session snapshot is saved (default 30 seconds). |
| `UpperLeftCorner`, `Vertical`, `Horizontal`, `Seprator`, `ListSeparator` and the other border entries | The characters used to draw frames and the list column separator. |
| `EqualizerEnabled`, `EqualizerBands` | Whether the equalizer is on, and its ten band gains in dB (−12 to 12) for 31, 62, 125, 250, 500 Hz, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 kHz, for example `EqualizerBands=0,3,-2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`. Normally changed with the `SHIFT+E` overlay, which writes them here. Values outside the range are limited to it. A line with fewer or more than ten valid numbers is ignored. |
| `EqualizerPreset` | One **custom preset** per line: the ten gains, a `\|`, then the name, for example `EqualizerPreset=4,3,1,0,-1,0,1,2,3,4\|My Mix`. The gains use the same band order as `EqualizerBands`. Created and deleted with `S` and `DEL` / `X` in the `SHIFT+E` overlay, which rewrites these lines. If you edit them by hand: a line without a `\|`, with an empty name, with the name of a built-in preset, with a name that appears twice, or with fewer or more than ten valid gains is ignored, and only the first 24 presets are used. |
