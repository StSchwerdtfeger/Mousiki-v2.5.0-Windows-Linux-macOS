    //
    // When `fast_script_path` names a real file (scripts/fast_yt_search.py,
    // resolved once at startup -- see find_fast_search_script() in
    // app.cpp), that script is tried first: it hits YouTube's search
    // endpoint directly over HTTP instead of shelling out to yt-dlp,
    // which is the heavier of the two paths -- yt-dlp is a general-
    // purpose extractor for hundreds of sites and pays for that
    // generality in startup time, on every keystroke-triggered search.
    // yt-dlp is used as the fallback whenever the fast path comes back
    // empty, for any reason: the script wasn't found, Python isn't on
    // PATH, the network call failed, or the query genuinely has zero
    // results. That last case makes the fallback nearly free in the
    // common case (a real query already found something) while still
    // giving yt-dlp's own retry/extraction logic a chance on the ones
    // that aren't. Pass an empty path to skip the fast path entirely.
    //
    // The two are not quite equivalent: the fast path can't replicate
    // yt-dlp's "categories *= 'Music'" half of its result filter (that
    // needs a second request per video, which defeats the purpose), only
    // the "duration >= 90s" half. In practice that means the fast path
    // may occasionally surface a non-music video yt-dlp would have
    // filtered out; it will not surface shorts or live streams, both of
    // which are dropped by duration in the script itself.
