// Which keyboard layout is in use, so the cheat sheets can name the key that switches between the music player and the
// radio the way it is printed on THIS keyboard. The switch key types the character '*' (the key is checked as that
// character), which sits on different keys on different layouts:
//   German / Austrian / Spanish / Italian   SHIFT and the + key        -> "SHIFT and +"
//   US / UK / Irish / Canadian / Australian SHIFT and the 8 key         -> "SHIFT+8"
//   anything else, or unknown               just the character          -> "*"
// Detection (once, cached): Linux XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT, `setxkbmap -query`, `localectl status`, /etc/default/keyboard, then the
// locale; macOS the selected input source; Windows GetKeyboardLayout().
