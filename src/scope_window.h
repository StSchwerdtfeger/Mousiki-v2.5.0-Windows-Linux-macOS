// The oscilloscope (SHIFT+9) and the spectrogram (SHIFT+8) in their own windows, in the player and in the radio.
//
// Each window is a second copy of this very program started as `mousiki --scope-window` / `mousiki --spectro-window`. It draws with the graphics card
// through SDL2 (zlib licence), which is loaded at run time (SDL2.dll / libSDL2-2.0.so.0 / libSDL2-2.0.0.dylib): the
// build needs nothing extra, and without SDL2 everything else works and the key only reports that SDL2 is missing.
//
// Why a separate process: on macOS a window has to live on the main thread, which here belongs to the terminal UI; a
// window that is dragged or minimised on Windows stalls its own message loop, which must never stall the UI or the
// audio; and a graphics driver problem can at worst close the scope window, not the player.
//
// Data path: the audio callback (player or radio) copies what went to the device into a lock-free ring
// (scope_feed_push: one atomic load while the window is closed); a sender thread moves it every few milliseconds through
// a pipe to the window process, together with the scope settings (ScopeWinConfig) whenever they change. The window
// draws EVERY sample once, as a beam that leaves phosphor afterglow, at the monitor's refresh rate.
