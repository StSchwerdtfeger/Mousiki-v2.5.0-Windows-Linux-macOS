// Plays back a StreamingPcm buffer (mono or stereo) through a real audio device via
// miniaudio, using the backend pinned in audio_backend.h
// (PulseAudio/ALSA -> PipeWire on Linux, WASAPI on Windows, OpenSL ES on
// Android).
//
// This reads from a buffer that may STILL BE FILLING IN — play() can be
// called the moment decode starts (as soon as duration is known from
// ffprobe and the buffer's capacity is reserved), and the callback below
// just plays silence for any frame past what's been decoded so far,
// self-correcting once the decode thread catches up. That's what lets
// playback start almost immediately instead of waiting for the whole
// track to decode first.
//
// This replaced an earlier ffplay-subprocess design. ffplay's audio
// output goes through SDL, and SDL's Android backend expects to be
// running inside a proper Activity with its Java glue — a plain Termux
// CLI process has neither, so SDL_OpenAudioDevice effectively never
// succeeds there and nothing plays, silently. Talking to OpenSL ES
// directly through miniaudio sidesteps that entirely.
