// stream has no duration, no seek position, no end, and StreamingPcm is built
// on exactly those three things. Sharing only the *visualizers* (FFT spectrum
// and XY oscilloscope, both of which just want a block of samples) keeps the
// two audio paths independent: the music player can change without breaking
// radio, and the other way round.
